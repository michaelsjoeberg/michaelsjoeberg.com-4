EQZEN beta updates

Just deployed several updates to EQZEN Beta: stock rows now blink green or red on price movement; new stock page to search and filter all available stocks; portfolio holdings are now editable inline (and updated automatically); add new stock moved to stock page.

Currently experimenting with a showcase portfolio feature, basically to share your portfolio as read-only (inspired by *r/stocks* Rate My Portfolio threads). There are some technical difficulties with sharing at the moment, since portfolios are not stored anywhere, so need to implement a way to store portfolio content outside of sessions.

Also notable, replaced twitter tracker with a simple feedback button.
