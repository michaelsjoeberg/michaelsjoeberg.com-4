I'm using Dreamhost as my domain registrar and wanted to keep all domains there, but also host on AWS, Heroku, or similar. Hence, the issues with DNS, ALIAS, CNAME, etc.

**AWS**

- Create a new hosted zone (AWS Route 53)
- Add the provided NS to registered domain (Dreamhost)
- Add ALIAS to EB instance and CNAME to naked domain (Route 53)
- Issue certificate to naked domain and include subdomains, or asterisk (AWS Certificate Manager)
- Add port listener 443 HTTPS and link with issued certificate (AWS EB Load Balancer)

**Heroku via Cloudflare** 

- Add a new website (Cloudflare)
- Add provided NS to registered domain (Dreamhost)
- Add CNAME @ to \*.herokuapp url (Cloudflare)
- Add CNAME www to \*.herokuapp url (Cloudflare)
- Issue certificate (Heroku)
- Add naked domain and www domain to domain list (Heroku)
