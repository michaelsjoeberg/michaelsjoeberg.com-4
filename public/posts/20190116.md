LearnHub.io landing page updates

I made some minor styling changes (mainly responsive layout) and updated the landing page for LearnHub.io, it now has more focus on skill tracking and development. It previously redirected incoming traffic to the explore pathways page, which still is unfinished, and provided little engagement.

I also added a tweet-at-me button as replacement for feedback form on each page.
