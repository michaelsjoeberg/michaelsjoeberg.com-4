A brief catch up

I'm producing *massive* amounts of notes on postgraduate material covering **artificial intelligence** (i.e. probability and automated reasoning), **agent-based systems**, **computer vision**, and general lower-level computer engineering.

I want to publish these notes somewhere (or at least parts of it), was thinking [Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelsjoeberg), but not as convenient, otherwise this website, or a combination (maybe shorter stuff here and guides or similar elsewhere?).

### Website upgrades

Other than minor layout and styling changes (increased color contrast between buttons etc and background), also updated post/ blog system; it was based on only JSON before (neat and easy), but wanted to use markdown (my preferred note-taking language). So, basically, instead of reading posts from JSON, it's now reading filenames from JSON (in dir /posts), loading md-file, and rendering HTML from markdown as post, which makes formatting a lot better.

**EDIT (January 27, 2020): Link to Medium profile no longer working. I will not use Medium, and instead post everyhing on this website.**
