Quick update

I updated this website to show my most recent posts on home page, but instead removed recent GitHub and Twitter activity? Not sure if better, but can always change back in the future. Also deciding whether to focus on Ruby (or other newer languages) going forward, or take some steps back to C++, or Java.

I will continue with project development related posts in the coming weeks, been busy with graduate applications recently (surprisingly time consuming!).
