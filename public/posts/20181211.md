Doolio.co future plans

I have been working on Doolio.co 2.0 for the past few weeks, mainly moving from PHP + MySQL to Python + MongoDB, most previous progress with screenshots are on Twitter. The goal is to launch 2.0 before end of this year, in about 20 days. Initial functionality will be more or less the same as the currently available application (skill tracker with evidence).

The problem I want to solve going forward is to provide some sort of quality assurance to online learning resources. Today, you can either pay Udacity, or similar, hoping it is worth your time and money, or try multiple free courses until you almost randomly find something good. I believe most learners want to know what is good before enrolling, and I also believe most learners that already completed a course would want to help other learners (by rating, reviewing, recommending, etc.).
