EQZEN Beta is currently deployed as a web application (AWS EB), with a separated and extendable API interface (AWS Lambda). Portfolio-files are stored on the user's local filesystem (XML) and investment data (number of shares, cost, etc.) is temporarily uploaded to a database (MongoDB) to make changes.

A few highlights: Privacy aware investors can create and track equity investments without creating an account. Paid features will be available to provide additional functionality (linked with email or similar). Stock data is sourced from reliable sources and updated frequently to provide most recent prices. Portfolio files are stored locally and easy to share. Focus on user experience and simplicity.

Upcoming features include: Inline editing portfolio data, Telegram bot to manage portfolio and request stock data (utilising the already developed API), Twitter bot to publish market data.
