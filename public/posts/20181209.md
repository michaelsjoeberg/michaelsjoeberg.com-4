This is the first post! Other posts will be about current project tasks and issues, similar to a project journal. I post on Twitter as well, but this website and page will be the main source on development updates and other activities.

I'm also going to post my (non-academic) reviews of recent research paper (less frequently), particularly in web technologies, software engineering, or other related fields. Link to papers etc. is below each post for easy access.

**EDIT (December 09, 2018): If I ever need to add something, or edit an error (other than typos), this is what it will look like.**
