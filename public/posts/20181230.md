Doolio.co development moved to LearnHub.io

December 30, 2018

LearnHub.io is a skill tracker with user-curated pathways to make life easier for self-learners. User accounts are not migrated and previous users are required to sign up again, or explore pathways without an account. Future development will continue there instead and traffic will soon be redirected.

I have made the GitHub repo public for Doolio.co, it was built with PHP, HTML, Sass, and MySQL. Feel free to clone and build similar PHP applications using code in this repo!
