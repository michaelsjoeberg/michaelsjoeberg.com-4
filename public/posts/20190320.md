EQZEN beta improvements

Just deployed some improvements to the portfolio page form inputs; placeholder with null value instead of zero values, to avoid deleting zero values before input, better orchestration between internal functions; added function to retrieve stock currently in portfolio, to better handle action buttons based on holdings.

I need to improve data load and page speed, added compression (Flask-Compress) as a first step, and to keep focus on workflow, continuously trying to make it easier and faster to use.

Also reworked all stocks table, on stocks page, which now includes a button to directly add stock to portfolio (if stock not in portfolio), which makes adding multiple stocks faster.

Showcase portfolio feature is still being considered, but need to focus on a few more behind-the-scenes improvements first, such as removing empty portfolios in database (which is piling up quickly), and solving the distributed storage issue with AWS (likely involving a separated temporary storage for uploaded portfolio files).
